# Since When News Analyzer

I don't always read the news, and when I do, I don't know what's the cadence in
which they update.

Since when shows a short list of the most repeated, or impactful news articles
per time span. You can use this to catch up on the news, or to see what's been
happening since you last checked.

# Installing

Because of the types shared between the server and the client, I'm using pnmp to
manage the packages.

```
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```
